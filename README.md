# Mini-lesson on Exceptions in Python
Just a short (30 min) peer lesson on exceptions in Python, for CIT-129

**What's in this repository:**
* A PDF (text-searchable) with some quick hints/how to use exceptions
* The same PDF set up to print twice per page to save paper (not text-searchable)
* A Jupyter notebook with demonstration code

# Further reading:
* Very accessible intro to how exceptions are written in Python: [Python Exceptions: An Introduction](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)

* Some good information (e.g. `for` loops are built on exceptions! what!) and clarified my thinking somewhat, but not exactly a tutorial: [Write Cleaner Python: Use Exceptions](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/02/06/write-cleaner-python-use-exceptions/)

* His examples are in Ruby, and his writing uses gendered language, but this is otherwise a fairly readable description of when exceptions are most appropriate, in general (rather than in Python):
[Coding Hell's How and When (Not) to Use Exceptions](http://www.codinghell.ch/blog/2013/03/31/how-and-when-not-to-use-exceptions/)

* Obviously, chapter 33 of Lutz's _Learning Python_, as mentioned in the assignment üòÅ
